# Hand Tracking Module

This repository contains the implementation of a Hand Tracking Module using OpenCV and MediaPipe. The module is designed to detect and track hands in real-time, providing key points for various hand positions that can be used for gesture recognition and other applications.

## Features

- **Real-time hand tracking**: Leverages computer vision techniques for fast and efficient hand detection.
- **High accuracy**: Uses MediaPipe's pre-trained hand tracking model for precise key point localization.
- **Customizable**: Allows for easy adjustments to improve performance based on specific use cases.
- **Python-based implementation**: Easily integrates with other Python-based projects.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
